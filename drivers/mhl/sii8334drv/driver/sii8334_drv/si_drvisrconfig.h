// SiiMhlTxDeviceIsr
//
// This function must be called from a master interrupt handler or any polling
// loop in the host software. SiiMhlTxGetEvents will not look at these
// events assuming firmware is operating in interrupt driven mode. MhlTx component
// performs a check of all its internal status registers to see if a hardware event
// such as connection or disconnection has happened or an RCP message has been
// received from the connected device.
// MhlTx code will ensure concurrency by asking the host software and hardware to
// disable interrupts and restore when completed. Device interrupts are cleared by
// the MhlTx component before returning back to the caller. Any handling of
// programmable interrupt controller logic if present in the host will have to
// be done by the caller after this function returns back.

// This function has no parameters and returns nothing.
//
// This is the master interrupt handler for 9244. It calls sub handlers
// of interest. Still couple of status would be required to be picked up
// in the monitoring routine (Sii9244TimerIsr)
//
// To react in least amount of time hook up this ISR to processor's
// interrupt mechanism.
//
// Just in case environment does not provide this, set a flag so we
// call this from our monitor (Sii9244TimerIsr) in periodic fashion.
//
// Device Interrupts we would look at
//		RGND		= to wake up from D3
//		MHL_EST 	= connection establishment
//		CBUS_LOCKOUT= Service USB switch
//		RSEN_LOW	= Disconnection deglitcher
//		CBUS 		= responder to peer messages
//					  Especially for DCAP etc time based events
